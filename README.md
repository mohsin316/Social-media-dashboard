## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- sass
- gulp 
- npm packages

### What I learned

This was my first time using sass and gulp and it really was adifferenct experience using these tools. Firstly id like to say that this solution is by coder coder's FEM challenge tutorial for this challenge. I followed along her tutorial and made this. I learnt alot and cant wait to make more projects using sass!

### Continued development

For future plans for now its to do more and more javascript. I just recently finished a course for it and i want to use my new hand skills and make amazing projects. I am super glad frontend mentor exists. I might study a framework or start a little bit on the backend. In fact i was considering looking up a few videos on using Figma and learn how to design proper websites.
